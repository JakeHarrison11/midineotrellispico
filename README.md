# midineotrellispico
 Use an Adafruit Neotrellis and a Raspberry Pi Pico as a simple MIDI controller 

# Requirements 
 You'll need CircuitPython running on your Pico to use this project. Once cloned, just copy `code.py` to the `CIRCUITPY` drive mounted to your computer and add all the libraries into the `lib` folder.

 These libraries are required to get started:

 * adafruit_bus_device
 * adafruit_register
 * adafruit_seesaw
 * adafruit_neotrellis
 * adafruit_midi

# Wiring
 The code uses the SDL and SDA pins on GP0 and GP1 of the Raspberry Pi Pico.
